//Tell A Personal Story
//I was going to continue with the whole car thing, but
//this is about my family and every other day when my car hasn't been //stolen. I visited my Grandmother recently in Nassau, Bahamas for
//her 90th birthday and she told me about my Great2Grandfather
//who was Seminole Indian. I was shocked and amazed as I 
//listened to the story of my heritage, but I don't know if I'm Seminole 
//or just the descendent of a Seminole. This is just part of the story.
